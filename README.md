# Calculator
My second attempt at making a recursive-descent parser.

It is customizable, meaning that you can modify all operators, constants, unary operators and binary operators.
It also supports postfix operators.

# Features
- Constants
- Prefix operators
- Postfix operators
- Binary operators
- Functions
- Binary numbers (with 0b prefix, e.g.: 0b1010)
- Octal numbers (with 0o prefix, e.g.: 0o776)
- Hexadecimal numbers (with 0x prefix, e.g.: 0xFF)
- All constants are customizable¹
- All prefix, postfix and binary operators are customizable¹
- All functions are customizable¹

¹: by default the `CalculatorLanguage` has no constants, operators and/or functions.
